### üëâ What is Markdown ?

1. Markdown is a `markup language` used to add formatting elements (modifying the display of a text like bolding and underline) to plain text documents.
2. Today Markdown is the most used language for **websites**, **documents**, **notes**, **books**, **presentations**, **email messages** and t**echnical documentation**.
3. Blogging platform like `Hashnode` and `Dev.to` also use Markdown as their primary format for writing.

Therefore it is very important to learn Markdown for all those people who have ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboards in their hands right now and is a Software Enginneer by mistake (like me üòÖ).

### üëâ What is a Markup Language ?

1. Markup language is a type of language where we use certain symbols and make rules using them to control the style of the plain text.
2. Intellectuals üß† call these rules as `encoding` üòÇ.
3. Text style like **structure**, **format** (e.g. **bold**, _italic_, ~~strikethrough~~,  <u>Underline</u> etc) or the relationship between different parts of the texts (e.g. links) can be controlled with the help of a markup language.
4. There are many other markup languages. Some of them are [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX), [LateX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX), [Scribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribe_(markup_language)), [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML), [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), etc.

### üëâ What is Encoding ?

Converting information from a some **source** into some `symbols` for communation and storage. And Decoding is the just opposite, converting `symbols` back into some form which recepient can understand like Music, Video, Text like English,etc.

> So, `MARKDOWN` is type of language where we follow certain sets of rules to modify different component of our plain text document

### üëâ What you can modify in plain text documents ?

1. You can change size of your `Headings`.
2. You can `Bold`, `Italic`, `Strike` your texts.
3. You can add `Tables`,  `Links`.
4. You can add `Images`, `Videos`.
